### How to Create a String Session

To create a string session for your Telegram bot, follow these steps:

   - Start by sending the command /css in your Telegram bot. This command will initiate the process of creating a new string session.

2. Provide Your API Key:
   - Go to [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/auth) and generate your API Key.
   - Once you have it, send the API Key to the bot.

3. Provide Your API Hash:

   - Send the API Hash to the bot.

4. Enter Your Phone Number:
